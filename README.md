## 📖 About The Project

**Certificate Builder** is a professional web application designed to solve the problem of expensive, complex certificate generation tools.

Most other tools (like Canva or Adobe) force you to pay for bulk generation or require you to upload private student data to their servers. **Certificate Builder** is different: it runs **100% on your device**.

### 🌟 Why use this tool?
* **✅ 100% Free:** I built this as a free utility. No "Pro" plans or hidden paywalls.
* **✅ Bulk Generation:** Upload a simple `.csv` or `.xlsx` file and generate 1,000+ certificates in seconds.
* **✅ Privacy-First:** Your data (student names, emails) **never** leaves your computer. It is processed locally using WebAssembly.
* **✅ No Watermarks:** You get clean, high-resolution PDF and PNG exports.
